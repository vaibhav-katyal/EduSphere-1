# Project Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository link.

### Step 2: Start the Server
Navigate to the project folder and start the server by running:
```sh
cd <project-folder>
node server.js
```
This will start the server. Since the database is not yet deployed, this step is necessary for accessing the Group Page.

## Group Page Access
- The Group Page (Video Call & Chat) will work only when `server.js` is running.
- Video Call & Chat features are already deployed on the backend, so no additional server setup is required for them.

## Using AI Summarizer in the Library
To use the AI Summarizer feature, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the appropriate directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. This will connect the summarization service to the HTML interface, enabling AI summarization.

---
### Notes:
- Ensure that required dependencies for both Node.js and Python are installed before running the commands.
- If you encounter any issues, check for missing dependencies and install them using `npm install` for Node.js and `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python.

Enjoy using the project! ðŸš€
